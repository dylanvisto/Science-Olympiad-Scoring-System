//Page Description
//-----------------------------------------------------------------
//- Clicking on an event from the Event List Page (could be a view button next to the event; kind of like in the first and second assignment) will bring you to this page. Here the judge 	
//assigned to the event will enter the schools from the corresponding divisions participating in this event along with the schools score (use the School_Scores class here).
//- A button will allow the judge to update the scores for the schools (maybe a new page that takes the judge to a beanEditForm with prefilled entries?)
//-A button will also allow for a complete reset of all the scores and schools
//- There is also a box on the side of the page with the scores of each school but I’m not sure if a judge can interact with it at all. Maybe on a new page render, the scores will be sorted in 	
//  descending order in a table component or something like that.
