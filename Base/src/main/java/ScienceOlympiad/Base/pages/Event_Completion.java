//Project Description
//------------------------------------------------
//Here, all the events for a division will be listed into two tables. Clicking a checkbox or 	
//button next to an event will mark it as finished and increment a completion variable (say 10 events in division B, then the judge clicks the checkbox next to an event. 
//The page will re-render and display “1/10 events completed (10.0%)”). Unchecking the checkbox will decrement the 	
//completion variable and the page will re-render.
//------------------------------------------------
//- Total events completed will be displayed on top.
